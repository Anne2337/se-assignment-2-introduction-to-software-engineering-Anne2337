Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into separate, self-contained components or modules, each with a specific responsibility. These modules interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, allowing them to be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
Isolation of Changes:

Changes in one module have minimal impact on others. This isolation makes it easier to locate, fix, and test issues without affecting the entire system.
Easier Debugging and Testing:

Modules can be tested independently, facilitating unit testing and debugging. This leads to more reliable and maintainable code.
Simplified Understanding:

With well-defined modules, developers can focus on understanding a single module at a time rather than the entire system, making the codebase easier to comprehend.
Reusability:

Modules can often be reused across different projects or parts of the same project, reducing duplication of effort and code.

Independent Scaling:

Modules can be scaled independently based on their specific performance requirements. For instance, a database module can be scaled separately from the user interface module.
Resource Allocation:

Resources such as memory and processing power can be allocated more effectively to individual modules based on their needs, enhancing overall system performance.
Enhanced Flexibility:

Modular systems can more easily integrate new features or technologies by adding or updating specific modules without major changes to the entire system.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing

Description: Involves testing individual components or units of code, typically functions or methods, to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
Integration Testing

Description: Involves testing the interaction between integrated units/modules to ensure they work together as expected.
System Testing
